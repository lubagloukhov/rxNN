The ten-second rest for each interval is also held at the bottom of the squat as opposed to the top. Interestingly, this squat, in contrast to the "normal" Tabata squat, motivates full hip extension.

S'We are ready for a break from the neurological and orthopedic stresses of  weightlifting and hard and heavy leg work.  Here is an interval that the NSCA identifies as being smack dab in the middle  of the lactic acid metabolic pathway. Remember one of the advantages of  interval training is that we get extended exposure to cardiovascular work  without the muscle wasting consistent with extended aerobic work.  On the Concept II Rower set up for intervals and go all out for 60 seconds Row easy for two minutes. Repeat for a total of fifteen efforts.  This is a total of forty-five minutes, yet the work is designed to enhance anaerobic  capacity. Now heres the really cool part: even though this work is predominantly  anaerobic (lactic acid pathway), it carries a heavy aerobic benefit without the  disadvantages of reducing speed, power, and strength known to accompany  aerobic training.  On setup scroll the display to show meters in the lower window. On your first  effort throw as many meters up in the minute as you can. On the subsequent  fifteen efforts fight for as much of the first distance as you can.  On completion use recall to scroll through all fifteen intervals and record and  submit the meters rowed for each interval. If you need help setting up the rower email us at feedback@crossfit.com.  If you dont have access to a Concept II Rower, buy one.'

S'"Diane" 21-15-9 reps of: Deadlift 225 Handstand push-ups This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. Compare your time to August 5, 2003 when we did a "mini-Diane" at 15-12-9 reps. It\'s expected that you\'ll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill.  If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there\'s a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be "your Diane."'

Repeat 20 times. 4) "Super slow": Take twenty seconds to reach bottom and  twenty seconds to reach top again. Repeat 20 times.  5) Finally, how long can you maintain a 2:00 min. 500-meter pace average?

S'"Diane" 21-15-9 reps of: Deadlift 225 Handstand push-ups This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. Its expected that youll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management  work/rest timing to optimize time is an essential skill.  If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that theres a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics  this will be your Diane.'

Again, rest as long as you want then repeat  both efforts. Use the same weight for each bench press set.  2. If the first cycling and bench-press effort are true max  efforts, then the second and third efforts are not repeatable  no matter how long the rest. 3.  To test the quality of the first efforts and demonstrate  the point of the workout take a LONG break after each couplet. 4.

S"Rest Day  View image Eva Twardokens' L Sit on homemade parallettes featured in this month's CrossFit Journal.   Many of our athletes, if not most, are fully involved and committed to a sport. For these athletes the WOD (Workout of the Day) and their sport training and practice consume every bit of energy they may have available for physical activity. These athletes' plates are full.  Other CrossFitters are not committed to any particular sport and have the exciting option of more casual exploration of multiple sports and additional practice of drills and skills designed and selected to improve neurological fitness (balance, agility, accuracy, and balance). Many of these athletes are soldiers, cops, and firefighters and for them fitness is their sport. These individuals include our best athletes.  With precisely these athletes in mind we will be increasingly posting alongside the WOD (Workout of the Day) skill development tips, drills, and skills for the parallettes and rings. Don't be left behind; make some parallettes (and buy some rings!)."

The stations are:  Wall-ball  20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps)  Sumo deadlift high-pull 75 pounds (Reps)  Box Jump  20" box (Reps)  Push-press 75 pounds (Reps)  Row  (Calories)  The clock does not reset or stop between exercises.

The turn around at the top is immediate - no pause. The ten-second rest for each interval is also held at the bottom of the squat as opposed to the top. Interestingly, this squat, in contrast to the normal Tabata squat, motivates full hip extension. Also, the ten second rests dont seem as short with this protocol!  Life is a succession of moments. To live each one is to succeed.      - Corita Kent  Heres an interesting story about the Navys reevaluation of the sit-up: http://www.abmat.com/navy1.htm'

The idea is to perform  each in as few sets as possible. All of the reps from each  exercise do not have to be completed before starting some  from another exercise. Keep track of the reps and tally the  total sets to completion. Note time to completion. Final score  is total number of sets multiplied by time in minutes to completion. Notes:  1. One possible approach is to perform a near max set of  push-ups, go on to the pull-ups, do the same with the  sit-ups, etc. After the squats, go back to the push-ups and  run through the list again finishing as much as you can at each exercise.  2.

S'How many pull-ups can you do each minute of twenty minutes? Notes: 1. The lowest number of pull-ups for any minute of twenty minutes is the score. 2. Use assistance if you still haven\'t a pull-up. "You always have to give 100 percent, because if you don\'t, someone,  someplace, will give 100 percent and will beat you when you meet." - Ed Macauley A city wide pull-up competition for kids - great idea -  http://www.pull-ups-trainer.com/success.htm  There\'s a glaring inadequacy in most athlete\'s development that can best be  addressed with the pull-up or chin-up.'

S"One Muscle-up per minute for as long as you can go! Can anyone do one muscle-up per minute for twenty minutes? How far can you get? Note: 1. A muscle-up is pulling yourself from below the rings to above and  dipping to full arm extension. It is an unrivaled move for developing  upper body strength.    It is much more difficult than any pull-up or dip and consequently a  move of much greater potential for strength development.  2. If you don't have rings, buy them!! Rings have no rival for upper  body strength development. If you are serious about your sport/fitness  you'll pick some up. 3. We've listed some vendors within the message board. 4. If you can't do a muscle up, see how many pull-ups and dips can  you do in an hour?"

If you're performing without a partner, rest 60 seconds between each round, and find a regular 1-rep-max deadlift.  Sgt. Scott Lunger, of Brentwood, California, died July 22, 2015, after being gunned down during a traffic stop. A second officer returned fire, hitting the suspect who was later caught and taken into police custody. Lunger, 48, had served the Hayward Police Department since 2001 as a beat cop, on the special duty unit, gang task force, SWAT, was a Field Training Officer and acting lieutenant at the time of his death.

Rest as desired between Sit-ups and Tabata Squats. "Stick to the basics and when you feel you\'ve mastered them it\'s time  to start all over again, begin anew - again with the basics - this time paying closer attention." - Greg Glassman  Here\'s Google\'s search for Tabata Intervals.

S'"Diane"  21-15-9 reps of: Deadlift 225 Handstand push-ups This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. Compare your time to August 5, 2003 when we did a "mini-Diane" at 15-12-9 reps. It\'s expected that you\'ll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill.  If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there\'s a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be "your Diane."'

S'Today we are employing a drill the CrossFit crew calls the wall-ball. The wall-ball drill is  a deep front squat followed through with a push-press and overhead throw. The ball, a  20 lb Dynamax medicine ball should make contact with the wall at about two feet over your  reach and rebound to your hands where you immediately bring the ball back to your chest  and squat to absorb the impact. The movements up and down are mechanically identical.  Stand about 18 inches away from the wall. The idea is to be in constant motion either on  the way up or catching and lowering. The major faults here are either to not squat to  parallel and to let the ball contact with a thud rather than gently absorbing the impact with  the arms and legs.  Run 800 meters. Stretch for ten minutes.  Wall-ball for 50 throws within 2 minutes.  Immediately do as many pull-ups as possible in five minutes. Rest 5 minutes.  Wall-ball for 50 throws within 2 minutes. Immediately do as many pull-ups as possible in five minutes.  Rest 5 minutes. Wall-ball for 50 throws within 2 minutes. Immediately do as many pull-ups as possible in five minutes. Rest 5 minutes.

S'"Diane" 21-15-9 reps of: Deadlift 225 Handstand push-ups This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps.  It\'s expected that you\'ll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill.  If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there\'s a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be "your Diane."'

S'"Diane" 21-15-9 reps of: Deadlift 225 Handstand push-ups This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. It\'s expected that you\'ll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management (work/rest timing to optimize time) is an essential skill.  If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there\'s a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be "your Diane."'

S'Rest Day Fred Koch, Robert Blom, and Vidar Jacob made an important contribution to our understanding of abdominal training with their abmat work. http://www.abmat.com/intro.htm. Learn, train, and practice the abmat style sit-up as well as the L sit , glute-ham/Roman Chair sit-up, and hollowrock. Set goals for each of these exercises.  On the glute-ham and Roman Chair sit-up learn to lift with the Quads rectus femoris as well as the typically dominant psoas. The key to this is to attempt to extend the leg even though it may be nearly fully extended and to lift up sharply on the shin supports. If you have equipment that lets you adjust the contact pads, move the hip pad away from the hip and towards the knee to encourage more quadriceps use.'

S'Rest Day As an exploratory and a day of active rest we want you to go to http://www.audiblefaith.com/artists/rharrell/gympag/condstr.html And explore as many of these movements as you can in an hour. Don\'t focus on the  obvious and easy. You all know how to do push-ups, pull-ups, and sit-ups; try something  you don\'t know or haven\'t seen. You are laying the groundwork (no pun intended) for  some very advanced assignments as well as developing coordination, balance, accuracy,  agility, strength, and flexibility. Combine with lots of stretching.  I suspect that those of you who understand the rigors of the CrossFit Program know that  there is ample reason for the reduced workload today and yesterday. Take full advantage  of these two days of relative "active rest." Beware tomorrow!! I want everyone to concentrate on getting five good days of eating next week. Lets focus  on including as many of these elements at as many meals as possible this Monday thru Friday. Build meals around: 1. Fresh Vegetables. 2. Lean meat (poultry, beef, or fish) or soy products. 3. Monounsaturated fat like nuts, seeds, and avocado. While avoiding or at least minimizing the use of: 1. Sugar. 2. Starchy carbohydrates like pasta, rice, potato, and bread. If you want to report your efforts to feedback@crossfit.com on Friday for the week,  well give you some input as to how you are doing. Include foods, and quantities as  accurately as you are able.'

S'"Diane" For time: 21-15- and 9 reps of: Deadlift 225 Handstand Push-ups This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps.  It\'s expected that you\'ll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill.  If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there\'s a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be "your Diane."'

S"Deadlift 3-3-1-1-1-1-1 Go slow and heavy!  The late Dr. Robert Atkins was the Louis Pasteur of our times. If youll remember from science history Pasteur was ridiculed and vilified by the media and medical community for maintaining that disease was caused by microorganisms that lived all around us. Dr. Atkins suffered similar condemnation for revealing that carbohydrate not dietary fat was the culprit in heart disease.  The medical community is rapidly coming around to Atkins position and highly acclaimed science writer Gary Taubes brought the worlds attention to this shift in a piece in a July 8th, 2002 article in the New York Times Magazine entitled What if Its All Been A Big Fat Lie? This article had an enormous impact on the publics awareness of the medical communitys emerging acceptance of Atkins position. Reason Magazine published a poorly researched and strongly biased criticism of Taubes work by Michael Fumento in March entitled Big Fat Fake. Longtime fans of Reason Magazine, the CrossFit staff were sorely disappointed by Mr. Fumentos piece. Michael Fumento, otherwise, a first rate journalist, has published several articles and a book on nutrition that reveal his ignorance on the subject.  Reason recently published a rebuttal by Gary Taubes to Michael Fumentos criticisms on Reasons website that hit the mark. Following Taubes' rebuttal is a reply by Fumento."

S'Today we are swimming. This is a breathing exercise designed to improve  anaerobic performance.  Were taking a bit of a break. Get ready for Monday!! Swim the entire length of an Olympic Pool underwater. When able, return surfacing once at about the middle of the pool. Again, as soon as able cross. This time surfacing only twice, once at  about 1/3 across and again at 2/3 across. Repeat this pattern 4 times for a total of 5 times or fifteen lengths. Record your total time to complete the exercise.  Done right, this has much of the feel of drowning. Good luck!  Rankings based on total time to completion. Rest after each pass only as long  as needed to complete the next pass. If you should have to surface more than  the pass requires, rest andrepeat the effort.'

S'If nobody minds, we\'ll give the legs a little break today- How many pull-ups can you do in an hour? Success comes here by pacing and not going to failure on any set.  Rankings will be by weight class. Don\'t be foolish and fill in with any met-con (cardio) or other work.  You don\'t know what looms! Also, if you\'re current with the path  the other athletes have been following and your intensity has been  worthy of your best efforts you are long overdue for a reduced  metabolic load. Our "Workout of the Day" is engineered with great dilligence to care for  ALL of your fitness needs. If some days seem too easy that is because  workouts either before or coming are tortuous and the backing off is  warranted. We are feeding you a regimen that represents the ultimate  challenge for the world\'s best athletes. If you are concurrently training for sport, like most of our athletes, temper  your efforts to allow for successful sport training. This is a learned skill  requiring a finely honed sense of self. On the days when your sports  training regimen is lighter, tear it up with our strength and conditioning  workout. On days when your sports training regimen is tough, moderate  your efforts. Many of our athletes are able to engage the "Workout of the Day"  right up to and during competition by just "going through the motions" while  still "doing" the daily workout. Again, the "Workout of the Day" is designed to accomodate additional sport  training, recreational activity, or stand alone by simply modulating the intensity  of your effort. If you need help with this concept email at feedback@crossfit.com  and one of our coaches will gladly help you come to terms with this.'

We will continue today on our recurrent theme of core-focus.  1) Hanging from the pull-up bar SLOWLY lean back and lift your feet towards your  hands until your tows gently touch the bar. Repeat for a total of twenty times. 2) Arch rock for one minute. If you\'ve forgotten what the arch rock is go to: http://www.audiblefaith.com/artists/rharrell/gympag/condstr.html (You are supposed to be practicing for the moves on this page regularly anyway!! 3) Fifty sit-ups with substantial support (towel or abmat, etc.) under the lumbar spine.  Knees up and apart, feet together. 4) Thirty back extensions.  5) Hollow Rocks for sixty seconds. Again if you\'ve forgotten: http://www.audiblefaith.com/artists/rharrell/gympag/condstr.html 6) 20 Stiff legged deadlifts. These are performed with an arched back! From the stand,  bow down letting the chest lag behind as far as possible. Do not surrender the arch in  your lower back. Done right you won\'t get anywhere near the floor with the barbell. If  your mechanics are correct you will feel an extraordinary tightness in the hamstrings. 7) Hold an L for sixty seconds. Repeat two times for a total of three efforts. 8) Twenty five times perform a "hug-a-twinky". If you don\'t know the movement here it is: http://www.audiblefaith.com/artists/rharrell/gympag/condstr.html  Some of you may be tempted to slough off the moves that you can\'t perform. You need to  understand that what you can\'t do here clearly defines your deficiencies as an athlete.  Any reasonably conditioned athlete can do all of these without much difficulty. If you find  a chink in your armor, work daily on correcting it.'

S'Rest Day The nonviolent approach does not immediately  change the heart of the oppressor. It first does  something to the hearts and souls of those committed  to it. It gives them new self-respect; it calls up  resources of strength and courage that they did not  know they had. Finally it reaches the opponent and  so stirs his conscience that reconciliation becomes  a reality. Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968, American Black Leader, Nobel Peace Prize Winner, 1964) When dealing with similarly enlightened souls it does  do exactly that. When confronting the rest of the world this very same strategy turns you into Scooby Snacks. - Coach Glassman'

S'"Diane" 21-15-9 reps of: Deadlift 225 Handstand push-ups This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps.  It\'s expected that you\'ll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill.  If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there\'s a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be "your Diane."'

This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed before repeating. We\'ve used this in 3 and 5 round versions. Today is 3 rounds. The stations are:  Wall-ball - 20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps)  Sumo deadlift high-pull 75 pounds (Reps)  Box Jump - 20" box (Reps)  Push-press 75 pounds (Reps)  Row  (Calories)  The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of "rotate," the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is one point.  Add your points and post them to comments. 405 is the score to beat.'

Choose a weight that you feel you can handle comfortably for  twenty-one reps of regular back squats. These specialized movements  are tough! Make damned sure you warm-up thoroughly with "air squats"  and stretching first.  2) "Power squat": Lower and rise as quickly as you can while maintaining  PERFECT form. Repeat 20 times.  3) "Bottom to bottom": Lower to full squat position (thighs parallel to floor),  hold for a full ten seconds, rise and immediately upon full extension of hip  and leg return to bottom and hold for ten seconds. Repeat 20 times. 4) "Super slow": Take twenty seconds to reach bottom and twenty seconds  to reach top again. Repeat 20 times.  5) Finally, how long can you maintain a 2:00 min. 500-meter pace average?  Set the rower for "Avg 500 meter pace" and stop and record the time at the  instant you fall under the 2:00 minute average (2:00 for men and 2:10 for women).

S'Rest Day "It is of interest to note that throughout history, the rise and fall of nations has seemed to coincide with the rise and fall of the physical stamina of their people. Greece rose to the height of her glory (leaving her indelible mark upon the world) during that period when the physical vigor, the patriotic zeal, the independence and freedom of her people were at their height. Athletic professionalism for the few and a lack of strenuous participation among the many brought about a decline in the national physical stamina and a consequent decline in the power of Greece. The same may be said of the great Roman Empire and of Egypt. History indicates, too, that a decadent nation realizes the costly blunder it has made only after defeat at the hands of a physically superior enemy. A period of reorganization follows and attempts are made to imbue the nation with the need of physical improvement."    - "Gymnastics and Tumbling", Aviation Training Division, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, US Navy, 1944.'

Make a serious attempt at each  challenge and record the result. Save for late comparison. If you cannot do a muscle-up,  try anyway; the struggle is more important than the accomplishment.

The following circuit contains three elements and is a powerful whole body workout.  Each element is 45 seconds with a fifteen second rotation  (not one second more or you start over). Make five rotations. That\'s exactly fifteen minutes.  If you don\'t know the elements you haven\'t been paying attention.

S'Inman Mile From the U.S. All-Round Weightlifting Association, USAWA: The lifter will have loaded onto his/her shoulders a weight equal to 150% of bodyweight. The lifter will then carry the weight a distance of one mile. Gait is optional. Resting is allowed, but neither the lifter nor the weight may be supported. Records will be kept in both pounds and time. Should the weight be touched by any aide once the lift has begun, the event is terminated. The lifter may be handed refreshments during the lift. This is hard, and for many impossible. Start with 150% of bodyweight and see how far you can take it. Then, if not able to make the mile, rest and start again with largest load you estimate can be carried for a mile regardless of time.'

The ten-second rest for each interval is also held at the bottom of the squat as opposed to the top. Interestingly, this squat, in contrast to the "normal" Tabata squat, motivates full hip extension.

S'1) Bike 20 minutes at a warm-up pace. We are doing three sets of back squats at twenty-one reps each.  Choose a weight that you feel you can handle comfortably for  twenty-one reps of regular back squats. These specialized movements  are tough! Make damned sure you warm-up thoroughly with "air squats"  and stretching first.  2) "Power squat": Lower and rise as quickly as you can while maintaining PERFECT form.  Repeat 20 times. 3) "Bottom to bottom":  Lower to full squat position (thighs parallel to floor), hold for a full ten  seconds, rise and immediately upon full extension of hip and leg return to  bottom and hold for ten seconds. Repeat 20 times. 4) "Super slow":  Take twenty seconds to reach bottom and twenty seconds to reach top  again. Repeat 20 times.  5) Finally, how long can you maintain a 2:00 min. 500-meter pace average?  Set the rower for "Avg 500 meter pace" and stop and record the time at the  instant you fall under the 2:00 minute average (2:00 for men and 2:10 for women).'
