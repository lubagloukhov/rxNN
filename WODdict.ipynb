Here is an interval that the NSCA identifies as being smack dab in the middle  of the lactic acid metabolic pathway. Remember one of the advantages of  interval training is that we get extended exposure to cardiovascular work  without the muscle wasting consistent with extended aerobic work.  On the Concept II Rower set up for intervals and go all out for 60 seconds Row easy for two minutes. Repeat for a total of fifteen efforts.  This is a total of forty-five minutes, yet the work is designed to enhance anaerobic  capacity. Now heres the really cool part: even though this work is predominantly  anaerobic (lactic acid pathway), it carries a heavy aerobic benefit without the  disadvantages of reducing speed, power, and strength known to accompany  aerobic training.  On setup scroll the display to show meters in the lower window. On your first  effort throw as many meters up in the minute as you can. On the subsequent  fifteen efforts fight for as much of the first distance as you can.  On completion use recall to scroll through all fifteen intervals and record and  submit the meters rowed for each interval. If you need help setting up the rower email us at feedback@crossfit.com.

If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk.

Its expected that youll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management  work/rest timing to optimize time is an essential skill.  If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk.

The ten-second rest for each interval is also held at the bottom of the squat as opposed to the top. Interestingly, this squat, in contrast to the \"normal\" Tabata squat, motivates full hip extension. Also, the ten second rests don\\'t seem as short with this protocol! Dave Leys 15/6:55.

Rest Day For time 15, 12, and 9 rep rounds of: 45 pound Dumbbell Thruster Muscle-up Greg Amundson 8:54 [video] Run 5 K We are ready for a break from the neurological and orthopedic stresses of  weightlifting and hard and heavy leg work.  Here is an interval that the NSCA identifies as being smack dab in the middle  of the lactic acid metabolic pathway. Remember one of the advantages of  interval training is that we get extended exposure to cardiovascular work  without the muscle wasting consistent with extended aerobic work.  On the Concept II Rower set up for intervals and go all out for 60 seconds Row easy for two minutes. Repeat for a total of fifteen efforts.  This is a total of forty-five minutes, yet the work is designed to enhance anaerobic  capacity. Now heres the really cool part: even though this work is predominantly  anaerobic (lactic acid pathway), it carries a heavy aerobic benefit without the  disadvantages of reducing speed, power, and strength known to accompany  aerobic training.  On setup scroll the display to show meters in the lower window. On your first  effort throw as many meters up in the minute as you can. On the subsequent  fifteen efforts fight for as much of the first distance as you can.  On completion use recall to scroll through all fifteen intervals and record and  submit the meters rowed for each interval. If you need help setting up the rower email us at feedback@crossfit.com.  If you dont have access to a Concept II Rower, buy one.

For time: 30 Muscle-ups Rest Day \"Diane\" 21-15-9 reps of: Deadlift 225 Handstand push-ups This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. Compare your time to August 5, 2003 when we did a \"mini-Diane\" at 15-12-9 reps. It\\'s expected that you\\'ll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill.  If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there\\'s a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be \"your Diane.\" 6 rounds for time of: Run 400 meters 25 Burpees Set up under a bar that is one foot above your reach for the burpees.
